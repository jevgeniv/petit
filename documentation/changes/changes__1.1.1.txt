Changes between versions 1.0.6 - 1.1.1

* Logging is done via slf4j instead of log4j. Please ship log4j yourself or use any other logging implementation.
* petit-beanmapper does not depend on Spring anymore
* Spring updated to 4.2.5
* petit-converter module refactored. The behaviour can now also be fine-tuned via PropertyReaders and PropertyWriters.
Converters are still supported too. However, their registration has changed and is now done via ConverterConfig.
For example, the following method can be called on BaseDao class load:

  private static void addConverters() {
	Converters readConverters = ConverterConfig.instance().getReadConverters();
	readConverters.add(new NumericRangeFromStringConverter());
	readConverters.add(new UidObjectFromStringConverter());
	...
	
	Converters writeConverters = ConverterConfig.instance().getWriteConverters();
	writeConverters.add(new NumericRangeToStringConverter());
	writeConverters.add(new TimestampRangeToStringConverter());
	...
  }
  
* BeanMappingFactoryImpl now supports plugins that can decorate Property's. See DbAwarePlugin for an example.
